# Release-Report-Sync

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

Release Report Sync synchronizes metadata for [Release Report](https://github.com/Faltenreich/Release-Report).

## Development

Parse Sync requests data from multiple endpoints. Every endpoint requires an API Key for authentication purposes which must be request in advance. Currently following APIs are used:

* [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org): Offers metadata for upcoming movies
* <i>TBD: Offers metadata for upcoming music albums</i>
* [IGDB: Video Game Database API](https://www.igdb.com/api): Offers metadata for upcoming video games

This data is then merged at the backend into one single database. Parse Server is used as Mobile Backend as a Service and therefor MongoDB as database. Therefor either a self-hosted or third party instance of Parse Server is crucial in order to continue.

#### Setup

1. Create a database with following classes: <TODO: Scheme migration possible?>
2. Clone or fork this repository
3. Create config.json in the root directory with following content:

    ```json
    {
        "parseServer": {
            "serverUrl": "<Parse API Address>",
            "applicationId": "<App Id>",
            "javascriptKey": "<Javascript Key>",
            "masterKey": "<Master Key>"
        },
        "igdb": {
            "serverUrl": "https://api-v3.igdb.com",
            "apiKey": "<API Key for IGDB>",
            "pageSize": 50
        },
        "movieDb": {
            "serverUrl": "https://api.themoviedb.org/3",
            "apiKey": "<API Key for TMDb>"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Deploy cloud code
5. Schedule Background Job which executes cloud code regularly

#### Deployment

1. Deploy via command-line (e.g. to Back4App.com)
2. Setup project: b4a new
3. Push code: b4a deploy
